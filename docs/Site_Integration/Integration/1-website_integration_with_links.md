### 1.	Direct Link

The easiest way to launch the booking engine is a simple link:
```
https://hotelname.book-onlinenow.net
```
The link is redirected to the 1st step of the booking engine

### 2.	2nd Step Redirection

To launch the booking engine in the 2nd step directly, the link should follow the format:
```
https://hotelname.book-onlinenow.net/index.aspx?Page=19 
```
The link is redirected to the 2nd step of the booking engine, showing the results of room types and rate plans according to the Default Search Criteria:
```
Arrival date is the current date
Overnights = 1
Adults = 2 (default number of adults configured in back-end)  
```
For example:
```
https://demov3.book-onlinenow.net/index.aspx?Page=19 
```
### 3. Language Based Links
