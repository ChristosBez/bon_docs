# Language Based Links
---

To launch the booking engine for a specific language, the following argument should be added:
```
lan_id=xx-XX
```
where xx-XX is the language code.  See Appendix I at the end of the document for a list with all supported languages

The link should follow the format:
```
https://hotelname.book-onlinenow.net/index.aspx?lan_id=xx-XX
```
For example:
```
https://demov3.book-onlinenow.net/index.aspx?lan_id=fr-FR 
```
